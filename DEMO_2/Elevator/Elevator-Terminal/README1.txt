SmartPark Elevator Terminal Setup:

In order to run the Elevator Terminal code, Node.js, npm, as well as all the elevator terminal
dependencies must be installed. To install the elevator terminal dependencies, once in the
folder "Elevator-Terminal", run npm install.

With the dependencies installed, open up your command prompt and
navigate to the location where the SmartPark Elevator Terminal folder was downloaded. 
This folder is known as "Elevator-Terminal". When this folder is reached,
use "npm run dev" in order to start the application. The application will take a few seconds
to start and will then open up in your default browser.
IMPORTANT: If using Google Chrome, error messages may display due to being ran in the development mode.
For optimal viewing of the Elevator Terminal code, please use Microsoft Edge, as this was the environment
the code was tested using.
